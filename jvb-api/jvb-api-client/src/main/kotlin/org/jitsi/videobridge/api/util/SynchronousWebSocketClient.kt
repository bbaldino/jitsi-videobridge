/**
 * A websocket client which sends one message at a time, waiting for
 * the response (and returning it) before sending the next message.
 *
 * It also supports a non-blocking 'fire-and-forget' send.
 *
 * All messages are sent as [Frame.Text], every message *must* have a response
 * from the server[1], and all responses *must* be of type [Frame.Text].
 *
 * [1]: Rather than implement a request-response-correlation scheme, this
 * client simply assumes all requests will have a response and that a request
 * will be responded to before the next request is handled.  With this
 * assumption, we can merely handle a response each time we send a request
 * and it will keep requests and responses 'aligned'.
